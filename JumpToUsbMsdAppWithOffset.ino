/*
  Jump to USB-MSD Application With Offset in Flash - based on Blink example
  Blinks an LED twice fast, then sets up a jump to an application stored at an
  offset of 0x38080 in Flash.

  Combine with a uTasker USBtoSD-Card project compiled to run at offset 0x38080
  for a way to update the contents of an SD card connected to the Teensy without
  removing the card or reprogramming Flash on the Teensy.

  The jump is accomplished by setting a flag that is persistent through reset,
  resetting the Teensy to get the peripherals back to a known state, then
  performing the jump before this application starts.  The check is done
  using startup_late_hook() so EEPROM can be used for storing the flag.  A
  few peripherals are started by the time startup_late_hook() is called, so
  those are reset before jumping to the offset in flash.

  The resetPeripherals() function resets the minimum peripherals that needed
  to be disabled to allow a few tested applications to work.  You may need to
  reset more peripherals depending on the application you jump to from here.

  For complete instructions please see README.md included with sketch or here:
  https://github.com/pixelmatix/JumpToUsbMsdAppWithOffset

  This example code is in the public domain.
